    /// In the Arrange phase, the expected value is set to <c>true</c>.
    /// In the Act phase, a boolean variable <c>value</c> is assigned the value <c>true</c> as well.
    /// Finally, in the Assert phase, the test checks if <c>value</c> matches the expected value using Fluent Assertions.
    /// This ensures that the functionality being tested behaves as intended.
